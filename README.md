# Dataproject
In data project, this assessment makes me very confused! This is the first time that I do pandas. Thr first problem for is to finding the data. The topic that I want to find is about Chinese concert revenue in each places and months, but the data are not enougth to analyse. So I try to use many methods to find the data, so now my data is about the music events revenue in whorldwide.
Finish finding the data, onther problem was coming.How to analyse the data in my project. I should think about how to compare with each other. I choose two ways to compare, one is in global, another is in six regiions. It can compare very clear than I compare with each o=conturies. 
When I doing the graph, I find that when I see the whole presentation , some data graph can not have reationship with each other, so I need to delete and change to other data.
